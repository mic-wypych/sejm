The package provides convenience functions to access Polish [sejm API](https://api.sejm.gov.pl/sejm.html) 
and retrieve information on parties, MPs, votes, interpellations, committees etc.

It also provides a shiny app to interactively browse information on Polish sejm.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{sejm}` like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("mic-wypych/sejm")
```

## Run

You can launch the application by running (note this is not operational yet)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sejm::run_app() 
```

## Accessing the Sejm API

All functions for accessing data from the Sejm API start with `get_`. E.g. `get_parties()`
will get basic data on the parties in Polish sejm like their names, members count and contact info.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sejm::get_parties()
```
